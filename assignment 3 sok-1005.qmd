## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Task 1

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(ggrepel)
```

```{r}
df <- fromJSON("https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2021/12/20/us-coronavirus-deaths-2021/ff0adde21623e111d8ce103fedecf7ffc7906264/scatter.json")

```

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(state_name = state.abb[match(name, state.name)]) 
  
df[9, 7] = "D.C"
```

```{r}

figure <- df %>%
ggplot(aes(fully_vaccinated_pct_of_pop*100, deaths_per_100k, label=state_name)) + theme_bw() + 
geom_point(color="green", size=1.5) +
geom_text_repel(size=2.5) +
labs(x= "Total population fully vaccinated", y="", title ="Covid-19 deaths since universal adult vaccine eligibility compared with vaccination rates", caption = "Source: New York Times database") +
scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(scale = 1),
                     breaks = seq(45,80,5),limits = c(45,80), 
                     expand = c(0, 0)) +
scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 20, by = 5), 
limits = c(0,20),
expand = c(0, 0)) +
annotate("text", x=59,y=17, label="Lower vaccination rate, 
           higher death rate") +
geom_segment(aes(x=56, y=15.5, xend=54, yend=16.5), 
arrow = arrow(length=unit(.2, 'cm')), lwd=.5)+
annotate("text",x=73,y=10, label="Higher vaccination rate,
           lower death rate") + 
geom_segment(aes(x=70, y=8.5, xend=72, yend=7.5), 
arrow = arrow(length=unit(.2, 'cm')), lwd=.5) +

theme(panel.border=element_rect(linetype=3), panel.grid=element_line(linetype ="dotted")) 

figure
```

Task 2

```{r}
lm(deaths_per_100k ~ fully_vaccinated_pct_of_pop, data = df)
```

```{r}
cor(df$deaths_per_100k,df$fully_vaccinated_pct_of_pop, use = "complete.obs")
```

```{r}
figure <- figure + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)

figure
```

```{r}

```

A high value of one of the variables is likely to be found with a low value of the other since there is a negative correlation between them. The association is stronger the closer the number gets to -1.
